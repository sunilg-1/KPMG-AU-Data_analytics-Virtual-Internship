# MY KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship:
Welcome to my KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship! I participated in this program to gain practical experience in data analytics and learn more about KPMG's culture and operations.
## Overview
As part of my participation in the KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship, I worked on a project to help **Sprocket Central Pty Ltd** analyze and segment their customer base. The goal of this project was to provide KPMG with insights into their customers' behavior and preferences, so they could better target their marketing efforts and improve their customer experience.
It covered all the key Skills/Tasks of a data analyst including,
  * Data Quality Assessment
  * Data Insights 
  * Data Insights and Presentation

## Data Source
I used a dataset provided by KPMG for this project, which contained customer demographic and transactional data. The dataset included information on customer demographics such as age, gender, and income, as well as transactional data such as product purchases and date of purchase.

## Technologies used
  * Python
      - NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter notebook
  * MS Excel
  * Tableau


Thank you for following along with my KPMG AU Data Analytics Virtual Internship, and I hope my experience with Python has demonstrated its usefulness as a tool for analyzing and visualizing data.
